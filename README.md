# dnd-remote
 
An attempt to make DnD easier to play remotely in these socially-isolated times. 

## Overview

The goal here is to have a DM running the game with control over all objects, and several players with limited control over their own character. 

## 3rd party tools
- node: server/app.js runs on node.js
    - express
    - socketio
- SocketIO for Unity
    - make sure to download the (free) asset SocketIO for Unity and include it in your project. Project will break without this.
